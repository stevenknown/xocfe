XCOM is a concise and readable C++ template library.

The template library includes serveral basic data structures such as
Vector, List, Stack, Hash, Map, BitSet, Graph, Matrix and a lot of utility
functions to facilitate various C++ program development.

Beside the basic structure, XCOM provides linear programming solvers, include
exact simplex based on rational arithmetic,
the approximate method based on double/float arithmetic,
the 0-1 integer programming solver,
and the mixed integer programming solver.

It is well implemented and able to build whole compiler, or anyother project.

The XCOM project is consist of following directories:
|-- benchmark  # a list of testcases to estimate runtime performance compared
               # to std library.
|-- example    # a list of concise examples to demostrate how to use XCOM.
